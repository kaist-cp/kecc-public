# KECC: KAIST Educational C Compiler

## Install

Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Alternative approach using podman and container

```sh
buildah build --layers=true --tag localhost/uni/cs-40200:latest ./container
podman run --rm -it --init --userns=keep-id --workdir="$PWD" --volumn="$PWD:$PWD:rw" localhost/uni/cs-40200:latest
```

## Build

```sh
cargo build            # debug build
cargo build --release  # release build
```

## Documentation

```sh
cargo doc --document-private-items          # built in target/doc
cargo doc --open --document-private-items   # opens in default broswer. Firefox or Chrome recommended.
```

## Run

```sh
cargo run --features=build-bin -- -h                                     # print options
cargo run --features=build-bin -- -p            examples/c/fibonacci.c   # parse
cargo run --features=build-bin -- -i            examples/c/fibonacci.c   # irgen
cargo run --features=build-bin -- -O --iroutput examples/c/fibonacci.c   # optimize
cargo run --features=build-bin --               examples/c/fibonacci.c   # compile

cargo run --features=build-bin -- --irrun examples/c/fibonacci.c    # interprets the IR
cargo run --features=build-bin -- --irviz fibonacci.png examples/c/fibonacci.c    # visualizes the IR

cargo run --features=build-bin --release -- examples/c/fibonacci.c  # compile with release build
```

For more information, please refer to the [KECC User's Manual](bin/README.md).


## Test

```sh
cargo install cargo-nextest
RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run             # debug build test
RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run --release   # release build test

RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_write_c       # run write_c test

RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_irgen_small   # run irgen test using a small subset of examples
RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_irgen         # run irgen test

RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_simplify_cfg  # run simplify_cfg test
RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_mem2reg       # run mem2reg test
RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_deadcode      # run deadcode test
RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_gvn           # run gvn test

RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_asmgen_small  # run asmgen test using a small subset of examples
RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_asmgen        # run asmgen test

RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432 cargo nextest run test_examples_end_to_end    # run irgen, optimize and asmgen pipeline test
```

`RUST_MIN_STACK=33554432` is necessary for deep call stack for irgen tests.


## Fuzzing

We encourage you to do homework using the test-driven development (TDD)approach. You will
randomly generate a test input, and if it fails,
reduce it as much as possible and
manually inspect the reduced test input.
For example:

```sh
# Randomly generates test inputs and tests them
python3 tests/fuzz.py <fuzz-option>

# Reduces the failing test input as much as possible
python3 tests/fuzz.py <fuzz-option> --reduce

# Fix your code for the reduced test input
cat tests/test_reduced.c
```

`<fuzz-option>` can be `--print` or `--irgen`. It shall be the one used in [Run](#run).
For more information, please refer to the [Fuzzer User's Manual](tests/README.md).

### Install

```sh
# Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt install -y build-essential clang make cmake python3 csmith libcsmith-dev creduce
pip3 install tqdm
```

### Run

The following script generates 10 random test cases and tests your C AST printer:

```sh
python3 tests/fuzz.py --help        # print options
python3 tests/fuzz.py --print -n10  # test C AST printer for 10 times
```

We use `csmith` to randomly generate C source codes.
`csmith` will be automatically downloaded and built by the test script.
For more information, we refer to the [Csmith](https://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/) homepage.

### Reduce

When the fuzzer finds a buggy input program for your compiler,
the input program is likely too big to manually inspect.
We use `creduce` that reduces the buggy input program as much as possible.

Suppose `tests/test_polished.c` is the buggy input program.
Then the following script reduces the program to `tests/test_reduced.c`:

```sh
python3 tests/fuzz.py <fuzz-option> --reduce
```

`<fuzz-option>` can be `--print` or `--irgen`. It shall be the one used in [Run](#run).

### How does it reduces the test case?

The script performs unguided test-case reduction using `creduce`: given a buggy program, it
randomly reduces the program;
check if the reduced program still fails on the test, and
if so, replaces the given program with the reduced one;
repeat until you get a small enough buggy program.
For more information, we refer to the [Creduce](https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/) homepage.

**[NOTICE]** The fuzzer only supports Ubuntu 20.04.
It may work for other platforms, but if it doesn't, please run the fuzzer in Ubuntu 20.04.

## Running RISC-V Binaries

### RISC-V Documentation

- ISA: <https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/>
- ELF calling convention: <https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc>

### Install

```sh
# Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu g++-riscv64-linux-gnu qemu-user-static gdb-multiarch
```

### Cross-Compilation and Architecture-Emulation

```sh
# Compile C source code into RISC-V assembly
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc hello.c -S -fsigned-char -o hello.S

# Link to an RISC-V executable
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -static hello.S -o hello

# Emulate the executable
qemu-riscv64-static ./hello

# Check the return value
echo $?
```

### Debugging Assembly

You can use QEMU's debugging facilities to investigate whether the generated assembly works correctly.

Open two terminal windows.
In one, compile the assembly with `-ggdb` option and start up a gdb server with 8888 port.
(If 8888 is already in use, then try with a different port like 8889, 8890, ...)

```sh
# Link to an RISC-V executable with `-ggdb` option
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -ggdb -static hello.S -o hello

# Emulate the executable and wait for a debugging connection from GDB
qemu-riscv64-static -g 8888 hello
```

In the second terminal, run `gdb-multiarch` and set some configurations.
You should see something like this,

```
$ gdb-multiarch

```

Now you can debug the assembly using the GDB commands.
